"""
A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The consecutive
elements of array A represent consecutive cars on a road. Array A contains
only 0s and/or 1s:
- 0 represents a car traveling east,
- 1 represents a car traveling west.

The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars (P, Q), where
0 â‰¤ P < Q < N, is passing when P is traveling to the east and Q is traveling
to the west.
